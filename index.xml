      <description>As I am going through the Tour of Go I found there are some exercise that require some problem solving. I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my solutions that I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with for these. I&amp;rsquo;ll be updating these as I complete the tour of go!
Exercise: Loops and Functions package main import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;math&amp;#34; ) func Sqrt(x float64) float64 { z := 1.0 prevZ := z diff := 0.00000001 for { z -= (z*z - x) / (2*z) if diff &amp;gt; math.</description>

      <title>Beating Java AWS Lambda Cold Starts With GraalVM Native Image and Quarkus</title>

      <description>What we&amp;rsquo;ll be doing: In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to build a GraalVM native-image to be deployed on AWS Lambda to massively decrease your cold start times.
What&amp;rsquo;s the result? Java AWS Lambda Function with near 200 milliseconds cold start.
Some of the instructions for this article came from following instructions from Quarkus here - however this article explains some of the steps I needed to take to get working and hope it helps you too.</description>

      <title>Removing Mill Scale and Seasoning A36 Steel for Pizza/Baking</title>

      <description>Before I get into the details and my cleaning process - here is a before and after picture of the steel! Looks good right?! Let me explain what I know.
The &amp;ldquo;after&amp;rdquo; picture was taken on the final cleaning step as I was drying the steel. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet have any seasoning. Immediately after I did a coat of seasoning. (seasoned pictures of steel at bottom of article)
Pizza steels! Superior to stones.</description>

      <title>Circleci Monorepo</title>

      <description>Monorepo: A shared codebase that stores multiple projects in a single repository.
tldr: Final script is at the bottom of the post if you&amp;rsquo;d like to skip the walkthrough.
At least the above definition is what I think of a monorepo. I see a monorepo as a single repository that has subprojects that generates separate artifacts under each project. Each of these projects can be related or totally unrelated.
Some people frown upon the monorepo concept, however there is some empirical evidence to its usefulness by those who&amp;rsquo;ve adopted them (most notably Google).</description>
